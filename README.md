# GeoWordle
Challenge-Based Learning Project

Welcome to GeoWordle!
An alternative to the original WORDLE game. 
The slight twist is that you get to pick one of these 10 categories: Animals, Capital Cities, Car Brands, Countries, Lakes, Mountain Ranges, Plants, Rivers, Seas, and Volcanoes.
After picking a category, the game is self-explanatory as it goes back to the original WORDLE game.
The game also does not show you any hints apart from when you guess the right letter in the right position.

How it works:
1) Run the program and select a category out of the 10 presented by pressing the respected button.
2) A new window should pop up, allowing you to guess. You have 6 guesses. DO NOT leave any blank cells.
3) After you input your guess, press the guess button. You CANNOT edit your previous guess after pressing the button.
4) Check the "Guessing Progress" as that may indicate hints with respect to your previous guesses.
5) ENJOY!

Constraints & things to watch out for:
-The secret word only consists of 1 letter words (e.g. for countries: Bosnia and Hezergovina = Bosnia).
-In total, there will be less words than expected in some categories as multiple words secret words needed to be deleted or shortened.
-In some categories, only the most known secret words have been picked (e.g. for plants, not every single plant is included).
